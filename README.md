We're going to build this game up component by component, then implement our actions and reducers, and tie it all together. We'll also be styling as we go along as well. At a high level, here's our plan to follow:

Implement the overall grid square

Implement the game board

Implement the "next block" area

Implement the score board

Arrange the layout of the game

Implement the controls

Implement the message popup

Implement the actions and reducers

Do some code organizing and cleanup

Implement state and shapes

Connect each component up to state and reducers

Implement block rotation

Implement moving blocks

Building a timer system

Implementing Game Over and Restart
